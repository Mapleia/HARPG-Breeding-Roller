# HARPG-Breeding-Roller
HARPG Breeding Roller used for ARPG (art role play game) on the platform DeviantArt. It is used to generate new foals (babies) based on the genotype (genetics) of the parents.

The RPG admin will input the sire (father) and the mare's (mother) genotype and the roller will spit out the foal's genotype (genetic code) and phenotype (readable translation). This is the barebone version (works with all realistic breeds) and does not include any extra HARPG breed specific "mutations" game mechanics. This is coded to generate 3 different variants. 

There should be an HTML file (also includes light CSS) and the javascript file.

# COMING SOON
This will also be hosted on harpgtoolkit.com if anyone would like to test it themselves.
