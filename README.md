# HARPG-Pheno-Generator
HARPG Pheno Generator used for ARPG (art role play game) on the platform DeviantArt. It is used to generate new foals (babies) based on the perferred colours of the user.

Users can input and limit the number of genes included to be randomized, and choose to include or omit certain genes. The generator will follow the general HARPG standards when naming certain genetics combos. (For example, Tobiano (Tb) and Overo (O) will be named Tovero).

There should be an HTML file (also includes light CSS) and the javascript file.

# COMING SOON
This will also be hosted on harpgtoolkit.com if anyone would like to test it themselves.
